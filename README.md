# Indoor_hybrid_WiFi_LiFi_RIS
#This repository contains code to design and simulate an indoor model, consisting of 1 LED source and 4 reflective walls. 
#Direct_SUM_Power: power received at the receiver
#File 1: Total received power (in dB and in dBm) with receiver position at different coordinates on the ground
#File 2: Total received power after reflection from the RIS surface; a higher dimension (50x50) RIS enables better reception with RSS ranging from 20dBm to 50dBm in comparison to RSS of 10dBm or less in the absence of RIS.
#File 3: Showing dimensions of wall and RIS
#One_LED_Room_Model, One_LED_Room_Model_RIS: Main script combining all the functions and parameterization
#Power_CAL, Power_CAL_RIS: total power received showing how the channel gain varies for the path with and without RIS
